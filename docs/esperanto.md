Esperanto is a constructed language that was created in the late 1880s by a Dr. L. L. Zamenhof.

It has a regular grammar and a makes use of the Latin alphabet (though it adds some letters with diacritics, such as `Ĉ`, `Ŝ`, `Ĵ`, `Ĝ`, `Ĥ`, and `Ŭ`). Many works of popular literature have been translated into Esperanto, and there is also a great deal of original work written first in Esperanto.
